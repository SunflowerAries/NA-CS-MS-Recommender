Such a diversity of settings requires that the students have a strong foundation in the field of computer science so as to be capable of productive work anywhere.

Only by knowing these concepts can a student extend the knowledge gained in school into new situations.</li></ul><ul><li>A purely theoretical understanding is insufficient; the student must also be able to implement the concepts in a variety of environments. Every course in our curriculum requires the student to write computer programs. The student will use a variety of computer languages, hardware, and operating systems. The range of environments extends from machine language programming on a single board computer using a simple monitor up to writing applications software under UNIX on a parallel processor.</li></ul><ul><li>The ability to express oneself is an absolute necessity. Programming requires the ability to write in a formal system; the student must also be able to write in English. Comments, documentation, and program descriptions are an essential part of programming assignments. In addition, many courses require the student to write an expository paper on one aspect of the course. Typically a course is fairly broad in the discussion of topics; an expository paper requires the student to research and write about some topic in depth.</li></ul><ul><li>In a field as rapidly changing as computer science, remaining up-to-date is an essential aspect of professionalism. Students are encouraged to read professional journals, join and be active in professional societies and to develop the ability to learn on their own. Education does not end on graduation day; it must continue into the future.</li></ul><ul><li>As computers continue to affect more aspects of everyday life, the consequences of inappropriate or unethical behavior become more severe.

Upon the final approval of the Global and National Security degree at The University of New Mexico, the modules will be cross-listed in Graduate Studies and in the departments offering the modules.</p><ul><li><strong>Globalization, Technology Management and National Security:</strong> This module will focus on international competitiveness as a basis for economic and, therefore, national security. Competitiveness has elements of technology development and innovation, infrastructure in all its forms, financial capabilities to develop and execute such activities and many other interrelated factors. The module will cover international regimes of innovation and resultant economic activities; technology, R&amp;D and other contributions to innovation in civilian and military products and services; international agreements and cooperation and their effect on competitive activities; and financial systems and their effect on economic and national security and on competitive activities; and e) other related areas.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Environmental Security:</strong> Only recently have US agencies begun to take seriously the importance of environmental factors, including climate change and resources, in shaping national security. This module would combine contributions from Earth and Planetary Sciences, Political Science, Economics, and Geography and Environmental Studies to assess the scope of challenges to human and economic security, as well as risks of conflict, associated with environmental stresses. Topics would include the extent or projected climate, physical, and ecological changes; economics of climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation; scope of population displacements; infrastructural requirements of climate adaptation; and empirical analysis of the impact of environment on civil and international conflict. The module also focuses on key concepts in natural resource management, highlighting historical and contemporary case studies of resource-based conflict, and on understanding such paradigms as the human- environment relationship, scales of environmental governance, the special complexity of water as a fluid resource, resource dependence, and the &ldquo;resource curse.&rdquo;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Global Nuclear Security and Policy:</strong> Most graduates of UNM as well as most New Mexico employees have a scant knowledge of how Washington works. Some courses on how the executive and the legislative branches function would be good for both undergraduates and graduates as well as employees of the high-tech community might be interested. This module should help explain nuclear policy for technical people who are employed in the labs and the national security community.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Human Rights Law and National Security: </strong>This module would explore the domestic and international legal constraints on nations and non-state actors during times of war or crises. Topics would include: constitutional law (such as the authorities assigned to the branches of the federal government over foreign affairs), criminal law (such as the essential elements of criminal offenses, including terrorism), national security law (such as the authority of the Executive and the role of the judiciary in times of war), international law (such as the war crimes and genocide), international human rights (such as protections for refugees and minority groups), and domestic preparedness (such as the roles of federal and state agencies in the event of a natural or man-made disaster).</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Global Health and Human Security: </strong>This module combines the diverse fields of public health and preventive medicine, environmental studies and international law in exploring the challenges of population health in globalized world settings. Topics include bioterrorism, pandemic preparedness, epidemiological surveillance of emerging infectious diseases, non-communicable and neglected tropical diseases, social determinants of health, structural violence and the critical roles of governments, business and non-profit organizations in providing transformative leadership.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Fundamentals of Cybersecurity and Directed Energy and National Security:</strong> This module covers the fundamental concepts associated with assuring the security of networked computing systems. Key security building blocks including authentication, authorization, encryption and public key infrastructure will be introduced. It also considers the differences between threats and vulnerabilities, and provides a categorization of cybersecurity attacks. Key industry and governmental security standards will be presented, and fundamental principles associated with securing a system will be articulated. Finally, the module will consider how emerging technologies impact the design and implementation of security system architectures and how directed energy research will impact future conflicts.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Human Decision Making, Leadership, and National Security:</strong> The module introduces the psychology of human decision making from two complimentary perspectives. The first is the idea that humans are not rational but are still predictable in the ways they deviate from rationality. The other approach explores decision making from an evolutionary perspective and introduces the idea that many apparent deviations from rationality may be adaptive in a biological sense. The module will cover major models of decision making that account for the interaction of emotion and reason and how neural signals can predict biases and discuss the well-defined phenomena in behavioral economics, social psychology, and perception. Examples will be interpreted through computerized models and neural systems that contribute to biased decisions. In addition, the module will cover ecological and evolutionary models of heuristics and biases, including error management theory of &quot;fast and frugal&quot; heuristics, and will examine recent research on the evolution of collective decision making in human and animal groups.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>US Foreign Policy Making, Institutions, and National Security:</strong> This module will highlight the major principles of Us foreign policy, the history of key events in modern American diplomacy, and the US government institutions that are directly or indirectly involved in the making of foreign policy. The module will focus on a number of case studies, both topical and geographic, including international trade and commerce, major international agreements to which the United States is a party, terrorism and American military, diplomatic, and cultural response to the rise of radicalism globally. The theoretical and institutional approaches in the module will be used to analyze a variety of important historical and contemporary issues in economic and security policy.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Introduction to Resilience and Decision Making Under Uncertainty:</strong> This module will provide an introduction to the psychology of human decision-making from two complementary perspectives. The section of the course Predictable irrationality in decision making will present the idea that humans are not rational but are still predictable in the ways they deviate from rationality. It will cover major models of decision making that account for the interaction of emotion and reason, how neural signals can predict these biases, and discuss the well-defined phenomena in behavioral economics, social psychology, and perception. These examples will be interpreted via computational models and neural systems that contribute to biased decisions. The other section of the course The ecology and evolution of decision making will explore decision-making from an evolutionary perspective, and introduce the idea that many apparent deviations from rationality may be adaptive in a biological sense. It will also cover ecological/evolutionary models of heuristics and biases, including error management theory and the theory of &ldquo;fast and frugal&rdquo; heuristics. Finally, the module will present recent work on the evolution of collective decision-making in both human and animal groups.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>US-Latin America Strategic Partnership and National Security</strong>: This module offers the students a national security perspective and a cultural perspective of the US-Latin America strategic partnership. From a national security perspective, the module reviews and assesses the main features, concepts and issues related to the global security environment, paying heed to the U.S.-Latin America dimension.

Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics,M.Sc.,12,San Diego State University,San Diego,California,30.0,80,"<h4>Key facts</h4><p>Bioinformatics (we also include Systems Biology here) and Medical Informatics (also called Biomedical, Health, or Clinical Informatics) are related multidisciplinary fields that rely on data mining and pattern recognition techniques to discover biological or clinical patterns in large amounts of data, e.g. data mining. The majority of research and development (R&amp;D) in the two fields can be categorized into one of three branches. The first branch is the algorithm development branch in which R&amp;D specialists use mathematical and engineering techniques (sometimes also approaches from physical sciences) to develop new, more efficient, and/or more accurate methods to mine biological or clinical data.&nbsp;</p><p>The second branch falls within the software engineering paradigm and primarily focuses on R&amp;D in human-computer interface. Specifically, the branch deals with data visualization and the design of graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to easily visualize and interpret the results of the algorithms developed by the first branch. The third branch includes those who work on finding answers to specific biological or medical questions.&nbsp;</p><p>This includes those working to uncover the underlying mechanisms involved in specific biological systems or specific diseases. This branch also includes much of the work being conducted in the area of Systems Biology.&nbsp;</p><p>This program offers training for all three branches of the two fields. Students can specialize in their area of interest in the second year of the program, while the first year is individually tailored to primarily fill in the holes in the student&rsquo;s background required for her/his desired specialization. During the first year, students usually take basic courses within two of the following four disciplines (depending on their background): Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Mathematics/Statistics. All students are required to hold a thesis proposal presentation, but the oral thesis defense is only required for students in the classical MS track.&nbsp;</p><h4>Regional and industrial fit</h4><p>Because San Diego is a major hub for the biotech industry (the largest in the country), the proposed program is especially well-suited to the region. The purpose of the Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics program at&nbsp;San Diego State University is to first serve the growing need of the local industry for graduates who are familiar with leading edge biological and clinical problems and have the skills to apply computing and mathematical techniques to solve them. Because of the high shortage in graduates in the field on a national scale, it is anticipated that some graduates of this program will find employment in other parts of the state or the country. Furthermore, it is also anticipated that a portion of the graduates will choose to continue their education or work in the academia.
